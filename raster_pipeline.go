/**
 * SkRasterPipeline provides a cheap way to chain together a pixel processing pipeline.
 *
 * It's particularly designed for situations where the potential pipeline is extremely
 * combinatoric: {N dst formats} x {M source formats} x {K mask formats} x {C transfer modes} ...
 * No one wants to write specialized routines for all those combinations, and if we did, we'd
 * end up bloating our code size dramatically.  SkRasterPipeline stages can be chained together
 * at runtime, so we can scale this problem linearly rather than combinatorically.
 *
 * Each stage is represented by a function conforming to a common interface, SkRasterPipeline::Fn,
 * and by an arbitrary context pointer.  Fn's arguments, and sometimes custom calling convention,
 * are designed to maximize the amount of data we can pass along the pipeline cheaply.
 * On many machines all arguments stay in registers the entire time.
 *
 * The meaning of the arguments to Fn are sometimes fixed...
 *    - The Stage* always represents the current stage, mainly providing access to ctx().
 *    - The size_t is always the destination x coordinate.  If you need y, put it in your context.
 *    - By the time the shader's done, the first four vectors should hold source red,
 *      green, blue, and alpha, up to 4 pixels' worth each.
 *
 * ...and sometimes flexible:
 *    - In the shader, the first four vectors can be used for anything, e.g. sample coordinates.
 *    - The last four vectors are scratch registers that can be used to communicate between
 *      stages; transfer modes use these to hold the original destination pixel components.
 *
 * On some platforms the last four vectors are slower to work with than the other arguments.
 *
 * When done mutating its arguments and/or context, a stage can either:
 *   1) call st->next() with its mutated arguments, chaining to the next stage of the pipeline; or
 *   2) return, indicating the pipeline is complete for these pixels.
 *
 * Some obvious stages that typically return are those that write a color to a destination pointer,
 * but any stage can short-circuit the rest of the pipeline by returning instead of calling next().
