/** \class Shader
 *
 *  Shaders specify the source color(s) for what is being drawn. If a paint
 *  has no shader, then the paint's color is used. If the paint has a
 *  shader, then the shader's color(s) are use instead, but they are
 *  modulated by the paint's alpha. This makes it easy to create a shader
 *  once (e.g. bitmap tiling or gradient) and then change its transparency
 *  w/o having to modify the original shader... only the paint's alpha needs
 *  to be modified.
